# Essay Writing Assignment: Process and Final Project

Welcome to your essay writing assignment repository! This repository is designed 
to help you organize your drafts, sections, and final essay. By using this 
repository, you’ll not only improve your writing skills but also learn how 
to manage a project effectively—something every developer needs to master.

---

## 🗓️ **Deadlines and Goals**

The final project is due in **April**, but we’ll break it into smaller steps 
to help you stay on track. Writing is a skill that’s essential 
for developers, especially when it comes to creating clear and 
effective documentation. Since this course focuses on 
**Human Development and Values**, this essay is the perfect 
opportunity to reflect on the real-world cases, as the ones 
we’ve discussed.

## 📂 **What’s Already Done?**
You’ve already completed two assignments:  
1. A **summary and opinion** on James Rachels’ *"Introducción a la filosofía moral."*  
2. A **discussion** about whether to release data (as hackers did) or preserve user privacy.  

These two assignments are essentially the first two sections of 
your final essay. If you’ve completed them, you’re already halfway there!

## 📝 **What’s Next?**
### Step 1: Add Your Past Assignments
